# MLBA Project – Loan Data Analysis & Prediction

This repository contains a Machine Learning & Business Analytics (MLBA) project built around a **loan dataset**.  
The goal is to explore the data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance on a real-world style tabular dataset.

├── 13A_v3.ipynb      # Main Jupyter notebook – full analysis & modelling workflow
├── loan_data_set.csv # Loan dataset used in the notebook
└── README.md         # Project documentation (this file)
```

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Understand the loan dataset** through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. **Preprocess the data** (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numeric features where needed).
3. **Build classification models** to predict a loan-related outcome.
4. **Evaluate model performance** using appropriate metrics and cross-validation.
5. **Interpret results** and discuss possible business insights.
